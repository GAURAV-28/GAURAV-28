Hello!

I am Gaurav Jain, I am a Junior Undergraduate in Department of Computer Science at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. 

I am mainly interested in the applications of machine learning in big data analysis. I am also intetested in the applications of machine learning and AI in other domains like Finance or Medical Diagnosis or Law or Computational Biology. 
I don't have the sufficient experience in these fields but I like to read more about them and gain knowledge as much as possible.

========================================================================================

I like watching sports like Football, Cricket and F1. According to me, Messi and Hamilton are the G.O.A.T. and no one can change my opinion :)
